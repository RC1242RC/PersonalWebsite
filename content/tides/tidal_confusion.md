If you Google "how do tides work?", then you will come across a large number of explanations. NASA, Neil deGrasse Tyson, the BBC, and various surfing, fishing, and watersports websites have all had a go at it. In addition, forum sites like Reddit and Stack Overflow are filled with posts asking for help understanding tides, which ellicit varied and contradictory responses.

Most of these explanations are, at best, misleading, and at worst, factually wrong. But what is it that these explanations fail to explain properly?

## The single-bulge model

Imagine a situation where the Earth is a perfect sphere and is very far away from anything else. This Earth is motionless, except that it spins once per day. Imagine that the planet is completely encased in water, which is held against the surface by the Earth's gravity. The water does not spin with the Earth; it is completely stationary, while the Earth spins inside it. In this case, the depth of the water will be the same everywhere, and there will be no tides.

Now imagine that the Moon is slowly traveling around the Earth, completing about one orbit each month. Like the Earth, the Moon has a gravitational field which attracts the water. The water closest to the Moon is affected the most, and is pulled towards the Moon so that it forms a bulge. As the Earth rotates through the bulge the water level rises and falls, forming high and low tides.

Hopefully this explanation has so far been quite intuitive. However, there is a big problem with the single-bulge model. The Earth spins once a day, while the bulge slowly progresses around the Earth in the same direction - this means that one high tide and one low tide occur in the span of around 25 hours. But in real life, two high tides and two low tides occur in this time. The single-bulge model does not make sense.

## The double-bulge model

In order to fix the model, we must add second bulge opposite the first one. With two bulges, the Earth rotates through two tidal cycles in 25 hours, which matches real life!

Almost any explanation of tides will include a prominent image of the double-bulge model. But what causes the second bulge? Unlike the first bulge, which is intuitively explained via the Moon's gravity, the second bulge is not easily justified. The second bulge is, without doubt, the biggest source of confusion and disagreement surrounding online tidal discussions.
