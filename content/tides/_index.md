Most people know two things about tides; they come in and out twice a day, and they have something to do with the moon. 

But how do tides _actually_ work? This question turns out to have a complicated answer, and one which is both badly explained and poorly understood.

If you are curious about tides, and find the common tidal explanations to be unsatisfying and confusing (like myself), then I hope that the following pages will provide you with clarity and understanding.
