This is a personal store of traditional tunes I've learned, intended as a way to quickly reference them. There is a lot of overlap with places like [The Session](https://thesession.org/), but also more unique tunes that I've come across. You can use the panels below to filter which tunes to show in the table, and clicking on a tune will display the sheet music. This is built with [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) and [ABCjs](https://docs.abcjs.net/).
